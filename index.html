<h3>Classifying Speech Disorders Using Voice Signals
and Machine Learning
</h3>

<p>Developed a machine learning system that classifies speech disorders such as stuttering, dysarthria, and vocal tremor using voice signal analysis. The project combined synthetic and real voice data, extracted key acoustic features, and applied SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models for classification.
Results showed strong diagnostic potential, improving accuracy, early detection, and accessibility for speech disorder assessment through AI-driven analysis.</p>
